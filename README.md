# Temperature-and-Humidity-controlled-fan
This project aims to automate the process of temperature and humidity control using arduino-uno.
DHT11 sensor is used for measuring temp and humidity.
A buzzer has been added as a protection mechanism by providing alert when threshold temperature of sensor is reached.
The code requires DHT library.
